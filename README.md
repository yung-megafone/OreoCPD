Central Power Distribution Controller for Crown Vic Equiptment Console

By powering devices off when they aren't being used, you will reduce the load on your vehicle's engine. Not only will this make your car run faster, but you'll save money in the form of improved fuel economy!*

This device also makes parking your car much easier, If you are like me and run a lot of electronics- rather than unplugging everything and risking a broken connector each time you park, simply press a button and everything goes dark!
